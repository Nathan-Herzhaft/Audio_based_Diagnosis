# Audio Based Diagnosis

This small repo contains a practical implementation of code for predicting heart murmur diagnosis. 

Three algorithms are compared in a general framework that allows them to be measured and trained using the same methods. The algorithms used are relatively basic (linear regression, Random Forest and XGBoost) but are sufficient to obtain conclusive and promising results.
